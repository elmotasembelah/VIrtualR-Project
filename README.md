# VirtualR Landing Page Project

## Why it was built?

This landing page project was created as a personal challenge to enhance frontend skills, practice using React and Tailwind CSS, and improve efficiency under time constraints. The goal was to build a fully responsive and clean UI quickly while adhering to best coding practices. It also serves as a portfolio piece to showcase skills and gather feedback for further improvement.

## Technologies used

- React: Chosen for its component-based architecture and efficiency in building interactive UIs.

- Tailwind CSS: Used for its utility-first approach, allowing rapid styling and responsive design directly
  within the HTML.

- Vite: Selected for its fast development build and instant hot module replacement (HMR), improving the development experience.

- Netlify: Utilized for its ease of deployment, continuous integration, and reliable hosting of the live demo.
